This project is a React JS (JavaScript, not TypeScript) migration of a chat application originally implemented in plain HTML/JS. All chat logic, UI, and features from the original app should be implemented as React components using functional components and hooks. Use localStorage/sessionStorage for chat persistence as in the original. Use modern, idiomatic React patterns.
